Workplan

Task 1: Interactive modules
	Dynamic testing module
		Ensure simulated results are correct and realistic of field testing results
		Add ambient input capabilities
		Provide additional structures (i.e. more complex and assymetrical)
	Static testing module
		Complete preliminary implementation
		Add data for more complex structures
	Explanation videos
		For both modules explaining how to use and guiding education
	Test methodology descriptions
		Provide contextual content to describe the test types and best practices

Task 2: Case study 1

Task 3: Case study
Module improvements/additions (e.g. skewed bridge)

I-76:
plan of attack to answering the problems
what is happening
what is it sensitive to
what are special scenarios (e.g. platooning)

IBS:
how do dynamic responses cause pier crack


main tasks
objective
bulllets with types of activities

show that we are cogniscent of the need to link case studies with interactive modules
maybe highlite the use of testing and models to answer questions (i.e. virtual twin)
